    <p>Emperor Sh≈çwa, better known in English by his personal name Hirohito, 
     was the 124th emperor of Japan according to the traditional order of succession, 
     ruling over the Empire of Japan from 25 December 1926 until 2 May 1947, 
     after which he was Emperor of the state of Japan until his death.
     At the start of his reign, Japan was already one of the great powers,
     the ninth largest economy in the world, the third-largest naval power, 
     and one of the four permanent members of the council of the League of Nations. 
     He was the head of state under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan during Japan's imperial expansion, 
     militarization, and involvement in World War II. 
     After Japan's surrender, he was not prosecuted for war crimes as many other leading government figures were.
     His degree of involvement in wartime decisions remains controversial.
     During the post-war period, he became the symbol of the state of Japan under the post-war constitution and Japan's recovery. 
     By the end of his reign, Japan had emerged as the world's second-largest economy.</p>
